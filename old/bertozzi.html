<h4 class="top">Dynamics of Kinematic Aggregation Equations in Multiple Dimensions</h4>
<h5><b>Andrea Bertozzi</b></h5>
<h5>November 18th, 3PM&#8211;4PM in 939 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>I'm going to talk about recent work on aggregation models in which the
velocity field is a prescribed nonlocal function of the density. Such models
arise in population dynamics in which the species undergoes social aggregation
based on local sensing mechanisms. I will talk about aspects of the models that
lead to rotation, clumping, and dispersal. Then I will focus on the aggregation
problem and the role of the regularity of the interaction kernel in determining
whether solutions blow up in finite time. Solutions of the equations are shown
to behave like a multidimensional, nonlocal analogue of the derivative of
Burgers' equation. Numerical solution of finite time singularities involves
anomalous &#8220;second kind&#8221; scaling with weak blowup in an Lp space.
However after the intial weak blowup instantaneous mass concentration occurs,
with a unique continuation like the entropy solution of Burgers' equation.
Information is lost after the blowup due to characteristics impinging on the
mass concentration in finite time.</p>

<p>The talk will overview joint work with a number of colleagues including Chad Topaz, Mark Lewis, Thomas Laurent, Jeremy Brandman, Jose Carrillo, Yanghong Huang, and Jesus Rosado.</p>
