<h4 class="top">Droplet condensation in warm clouds</h4>

<p>From their formation onto tiny solid particles, droplets must grow of more
than three orders of magnitude in size, in order to become raindrops. To bridge
this gap, two main physical mechanisms are at work in warm clouds. The first
one is the growth by condensation of the surrounding vapor, dominant
immediately after droplet formation. Later, when droplets become sufficiently
large, collisions become relevant and droplets undergo a rapid growth yielding
rain. The great efficiency of the collision/coalescence processes depends on
the preceding condensation stage. In particular, since the probability of
collision is proportional to the velocity difference between the two colliding
droplets, it turns out that a population of identical droplets would be
eventually unable to produce rain. A population of very similar droplets is
exactly what one expects on the basis of a mean-field type analysis of the
condensation equation. The narrowing of the droplet size distribution and the
consequent bottleneck in droplet growth, are long-standing problems of cloud
physics. A better understanding of these issues is needed in order to get
reliable estimates of cloud lifetime, radiative balances and rain formation
&#8211; important parameters of global climate models. I will focus on this
problem and discuss numerical results suggesting that a broadening of droplet
size distributions can be ascribed to turbulence.</p>
