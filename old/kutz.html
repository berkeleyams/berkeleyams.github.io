<p>In general, there exist no analytical methods for quantitative analysis of
the nonlinear propagation of ultrashort optical pulses in fiber, which
underlies the operation of femtosecond-pulse fiber lasers. Such methods are
needed now as the current generation of fiber lasers promise to greatly enhance
the performance of practical instruments. In general, a pulse undergoes large
changes in its temporal shape, spectral shape, and phase or frequency as it
traverses a fiber laser, which in turn pose severe challenges to mathematical
models. Self-similar pulse evolution is remarkable because
monotonically-evolving, asymptotic solutions of the governing wave equation
exist, despite the periodic boundary condition of a laser resonator.
Highly-chirped pulse solutions can also exist in the presence of strong
dissipation, and these so-called dissipative solitons represent a new class of
laser pulses that offers remarkable behavior and performance. Quantitative
models for lasers based on these pulses will be developed from first
principles. These models will be studied in appropriate parameter regimes where
simplified nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be utilized. In all cases,
stability of the pulse solutions is the crucial issue. The theoretical efforts
are highly interdisciplinary: combining asymptotic and perturbation methods,
scientific computation, and rigorous mathematical analysis with models that are
based on, and validated by, experimental observations.</p>
