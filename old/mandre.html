<p>A high velocity impact between a liquid droplet and a solid surface produces
a splash. Classical observations traced the origin of this splash to a thin
sheet of fluid ejected near the impact point, though the fluid mechanical
mechanism leading to the sheet is not known. Mechanisms of sheet formation have
heretofore relied on initial contact of the droplet and the surface. In this
paper, we theoretically and numerically study the events preceding typical
impacts of droplets within approximately 1&nbsp;microsecond of contact. The
droplet initially tries to contact the substrate by either draining gas out of
a thin layer or compressing it, with the local behavior described by a self
similar solution of the governing equations. This similarity solution is not
asymptotically consistent: forces that were initially negligible become
relevant and dramatically change the behavior. Depending on the radius and
impact velocity of the droplet, we show that the solution is overtaken by
either the surface tension of the liquid&#8211;gas interface or inertia of the
drop. At low impact velocities surface tension stops the droplet from impacting
the surface, whereas at higher velocities inertial effects may cause the
droplet interface to overturn, signifying the possibility of a splash. This
inertial effect causing splashing is currently under investigation.</p>
