<p>An unresolved problem in physics is how the arrow of time due to the Second
Law of Thermodynamics arises from dynamics such as Newton's laws that time
reversal symmetric. However, there has been much progress over the last decade
for a dynamical process that begins in thermal equilibrium. For these
processes, one can not only prove the Second Law of Thermodynamics but also
more general relations such as Jarzynski's equality and the Crooks fluctuation
theorem, two remarkable results which will be explained in this talk. These
insights have greatly enhanced our understanding of single molecule experiments
which use lasers as chopsticks to manipulate a biological molecule such as
RNA.</p>

<p>While these previous results show that an arrow of time exists, we now give
a length to this arrow. For a dynamical process beginning in equilibrium, this
measure is based on the distinguishability of this forward process from its
reverse process, or the time reversal of the forward process. Most importantly,
this length of time's arrow can be measured in single molecule RNA pulling
experiments. It is also deeply connected with determining equilibrium free
energy differences.</p>

<p>We also show the connection between far-from-equilibrium single molecule
experiments and an equilibrium quantity called thermodynamic length.
Originally, thermodynamic length generalized the notion of curve length in
Euclidean space to the surface of equilibrium states in thermodynamics. We
define thermodynamic length for a microscopic system such as the RNA molecule
in a single molecule experiment. This definition reveals the link between
thermodynamic length and equilibrium fluctuations. To measure thermodynamic
length in far-from-equilibrium experiments, one must determine the equilibrium
properties at an intermediate point of the dynamical process. We show how to
re-weight the value of each pulling experiment so that one can determine these
equilibrium properties.</p>
