Title: Quantum Dynamical Systems for Optimization: Theory and Experiments
<abstract>
Classical algorithms are often not effective for solving nonconvex optimization problems where local minima are separated by high barriers. In this talk, we introduce optimization algorithms based on quantum dynamical systems. On the one hand, we leverage the global effect of quantum tunneling in the Schrodinger equation, which introduces a quantum algorithm termed the quantum tunneling walk (QTW). We apply QTW to nonconvex problems where local minima are approximately global minima, and it achieves quantum speedup over classical stochastic gradient descents (SGD) when the barriers between different local minima are high but thin and the minima are flat. On the other hand, we also consider open quantum systems coupled with a heat bath, which introduces a quantum algorithm termed Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) covering the practical case with random quantum noise to the system. We prove the convergence of QLD in optimizing convex and slightly nonconvex functions, demonstrating that the average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. The theories of both quantum algorithms are well supported by numerical experiments, and they outperform a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.

This talk is based on two papers: arXiv:2209.14501 (Quantum 7, 1030 (2023)) and arXiv:2311.15587 (in submission).

Title: Interpolation between modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincare inequalities for quantum Markovian dynamics

<abstract>
In this talk, we define the quantum p-divergences and introduce the Beckner's inequalities for the quantum Markov semigroups with detailed balance condition. Such inequalities quantify the convergence rate of the quantum dynamics in the noncommutative p-norm. We obtain a number of implications between Beckner's inequalities and other quantum functional inequalities, as well as the hypercontractivity. In particular, we show that the quantum Beckner's inequalities interpolate between the Sobolev-type inequalities and the Poincare inequality in a sharp way. We also provide a uniform lower bound for the Beckner constants in terms of the spectral gap, and establish its stability with respect to the invariant state.  We further introduce a new class of quantum transport distances W_{2,p} such that QMS with detailed balance is the gradient flow of the quantum p-divergence. We prove that the set of quantum states equipped with such a metric is a complete geodesic space, which allows us to connect the geodesic convexity of p-divergence with quantum Beckner's inequality. This talk is based on a joint work with Jianfeng Lu.

Title: High-threshold and low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory
<abstract>
The accumulation of physical errors prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction (QEC) promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits into a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity.  QEC becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit, and decoding algorithm.  We present an end-to-end QEC protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory based on a family of low-density parity-check codes.  Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.8% for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code ---since 20 years the leading code in terms of error threshold.  The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with CNOT gates, qubit initializations, and measurements.  The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph comprised of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs.  In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for ten million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1%, while the surface code would require more than 4000 physical qubits to achieve said performance.  Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.

Title: On the Existence of Solution of a Strongly Coupled PDE-ODE with Moving Bottleneck and Discontinuity in the Flux
<abstract>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
From an application point of view, coupled PDE-ODE problems have various applications in science and engineering including blood flow, and modern mobility. From a theoretical point of view, these problems show complex behavior which stem from the interactions of waves and creation of non-classical shocks. In this talk, we analyze such a PDE-ODE model with discontinuity in the flux as well as a flux constraint. We discuss the analytical complexities of the model and by proposing a modified Riemann solution we prove the existence of weak solutions to the Cauchy problem using the wavefront tracking scheme.

Title: Continuum Models for Twisted 2D Moire Materials
<abstract>
Placing a two-dimensional lattice on another with a small rotation gives rise to periodic “moiré” patterns on a superlattice scale much larger than the original lattice.  The Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model attempts to capture the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by an effective periodic continuum model over the bilayer moiré pattern. We use the mathematical techniques developed to study waves in inhomogeneous media to identify a regime where the BM model emerges as the effective dynamics for electrons modeled as wave-packets spectrally concentrated at the monolayer Dirac points of linear dispersion, up to error that we rigorously estimate. Using measured values of relevant physical constants, we argue that this regime is realized in TBG at the first “magic" angle where the group velocity of the wave packet is zero and strongly correlated electronic phases (superconductivity, Mott insulators, etc.) are observed.

We are working to develop models of TBG which account for the effects of mechanical relaxation and to couple our relaxed BM model with interacting TBG models.  We are also extending our approach to essentially arbitrary moiré materials such as twisted multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) or even twisted heterostructures consisting of layers of distinct 2D materials.

Title: Finite Expression Method: A Symbolic Approach for Scientific Machine Learning
<abstract>
Machine learning has revolutionized computational science and engineering with impressive breakthroughs, e.g., making the efficient solution of high-dimensional computational tasks feasible and advancing domain knowledge via scientific data mining. This leads to an emerging field called scientific machine learning. In this talk, we introduce a new method for a symbolic approach to solving scientific machine learning problems. This method seeks interpretable learning outcomes via combinatorial optimization in the space of functions with finitely many analytic expressions and, hence, this methodology is named the finite expression method (FEX). It is proved in approximation theory that FEX can avoid the curse of dimensionality in discovering high-dimensional complex systems. As a proof of concept, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to implement FEX for learning the solution of high-dimensional PDEs and learning the governing equations of raw data.

Title: Smoluchowski-Kramers diffusion-approximation for constrained stochastic wave equations
<abstract>
We consider a stochastic damped wave equation in a bounded domain of a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, endowed with the Dirichlet boundary condition, with the added constraint that the $L^2$-norm of the solution is equal to one. We introduce a small mass $\mu>0$ in front of the second-order derivative in time and examine the validity of a Smoluchowski-Kramers diffusion approximation. We demonstrate that, in the small mass limit, the solution converges to the solution of a stochastic parabolic equation subject to the same constraint. We further show that an extra noise-induced drift emerges, which does not account for the Stratonovich-to-It\^{o} correction term.

Title: High-dimensional PDEs, tensor-network, and convex optimization
<abstract>
This talk presents new computational approaches for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), employing tensor networks and convex relaxations. Specifically, based on these approaches, we demonstrate the construction of inner and outer approximations to PDE solutions using low-order statistics. These in turn effectively address the curse of dimensionality.

Title: Fine-grained Theory and Hybrid Algorithms for Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra
<abstract>
Randomized algorithms have gained increased prominence within numerical linear algebra and they play a key role in an ever-expanding range of problems driven by a breadth of scientific applications. In this talk we will explore two aspects of randomized algorithms by (1) providing experiments and accompanying theoretical analysis that demonstrate how their performance depends on matrix structures beyond singular values (such as coherence of singular subspaces), and (2) showing how to leverage those insights to build hybrid algorithms that blend favorable aspects of deterministic and randomized methods. A broad range of randomized algorithms will be considered, relevant motivating applications will be discussed, and numerical experiments will illuminate directions for further research.

Title: High-Order Multigrid-Reduction-In-Time for Linear Hyperbolic PDEs
<abstract>
 Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) uses multigrid reduction techniques to enable temporal parallelism for solving time dependent PDEs. Although MGRIT converges rapidly for diffusion-dominated PDEs, the convergence for advection-dominated PDEs is slow, or even non-convergent. For a two-level scheme with a fine-grid and a coarse grid, it is known that the convergence of MGRIT depends in part on the choice of time-stepping operators on the fine and coarse grid. In this talk, I will give a brief overview to MGRIT, some existing attempts to accelerate convergence for advection-dominated PDEs, and a proposed family of coarse-grid operators to accelerate convergence. This work is a joint effort with Dr. Robert Falgout (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory).

Title: Optimization, Sampling, and Generative Modeling in Non-Euclidean Spaces
<abstract>
Machine learning in non-Euclidean spaces have been rapidly attracting attention in recent years, and this talk will give some examples of progress on its mathematical and algorithmic foundations. A sequence of developments that eventually leads to non-Euclidean generative modeling will be reported.

More precisely, I will begin with variational optimization, which, together with delicate interplays between continuous- and discrete-time dynamics, enables the construction of momentum-accelerated algorithms that optimize functions defined on manifolds. Selected applications, namely a generic improvement of Transformer, and a low-dim. approximation of high-dim. optimal transport distance, will be described. Then I will turn the optimization dynamics into an algorithm that samples from probability distributions on Lie groups. If time permits, the performance of this sampler will also be quantified, without log-concavity condition or its common relaxations. Finally, I will describe how this sampler can lead to a structurally-pleasant diffusion generative model that allows users to, given training data that follow any latent statistical distribution on a Lie group, generate more data exactly on the same manifold that follow the same distribution. Applications such as to quantum data will be briefly mentioned.

Title: Multi-physics modeling in pediatric cardiology
<abstract>
Congenital heart disease affects 1 in 100 infants and is the leading cause of infant mortality in the US. Computational modeling is particularly valuable in this heterogeneous and high-risk population because of the need for personalized treatment planning. We will present recent work extending traditional hemodynamics simulations to include multiple physical processes and cardiac function in pediatric cardiology. In particular, we will discuss 1) melding constrained mixture models of vascular growth and remodeling with patient specific finite element simulations, and 2) multi-physics cardiac simulations incorporating electrophysiology, active contraction and fluid structure interaction. Novel algorithms for generating synthetic vascular networks for 3D bioprinting applications and simulating tissue perfusion will also be described. We will finally describe open-source software and data resources available via the SimVascular project and the Vascular Model Repository.
