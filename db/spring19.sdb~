Title: Adjoint sensitivity analysis of chaotic dynamical systems via shadowing methods.
<abstract>
In this talk we discuss how to compute derivatives of long-time-averaged objectives with respect to multiple system parameters in chaotic systems,
via the recently developed non-intrusive least-squares adjoint shadowing (NILSAS) algorithm.

First we review how to compute such derivatives via comparing the base trajectory and a shadowing trajectory, which is a new trajectory with perturbed parameter and perturbed initial condition, yet always lies close to the base trajectory.
Then we review how to compute such shadowing trajectory via a `non-intrusive' minimization problem on the unstable subspace.
Then we show our recent work on defining and proving the unique existence of adjoint shadowing directions.
Then we develop the NILSAS algorithm, whose cost is independent of number of parameters, and its implementation requires only minor modifications to existing adjoint solvers.
Finally, we show an application, by Chaitanya Talnikar, of NILSAS on a weakly turbulent flow over a three-dimensional cylinder at Re=1100, where the cost of NILSAS is similar to simulating the flow problem.

Title: Modeling near-wall transport in arterial blood flow
<abstract>
Computational studies of blood flow often seek to understand how local flow mechanics relate to disease progression. Of particular interest are biomechanical interactions between blood flow and the vessel wall, which is a nexus for pathology. In the near-wall region, blood flow imparts mechanical stresses on the vessel wall, and regulates the local transport of reactive material between the tissue and fluid domains. The latter mechanism, transport, is difficult to quantify since it is an emergent and chaotic process. Moreover, in arterial flows, there is disparate spatial and temporal scales between the macro fluid mechanics and near-wall processes. This talk will discuss our recent work to better characterize and tractably model near-wall transport in large-artery flows.

Title: Grassmann manifold, gauge, and quantum chemistry
<abstract>
The Grassmann manifold Gr(m,n) is the set of n-dimensional subspaces in R^m (assuming m>n), and is used in many science and engineering applications.  A point in Gr(m,n) can be represented by an orthogonal matrix of size m by n, multiplied by another arbitrary orthogonal matrix of size n by n.  In quantum chemistry and in particular the widely used density functional theory (DFT), this arbitrary orthogonal matrix is referred to as the gauge.  Physical quantities such as energies and electron densities should be independent of the gauge choice.  In this talk, I am going to discuss the interplay between gauge-dependent and gauge-independent quantities in quantum chemistry along three recent directions: time-dependent density functional theory, electron localization, and self-consistent field iteration.  In each case, the focus on the gauge-independent representation of the Grassmann manifold brings interesting, and sometimes surprising numerical benefits.

Title: Intrinsic complexity and its scaling law: from approximation of random vectors and rand fields to high frequency waves
<abstract>
We characterize the intrinsic complexity of a set in a metric space by the least dimension of a linear space that can approximate the set to a given tolerance. This is dual to the characterization using Kolmogorov n-width, the distance from the set to the best n-dimensional linear space. We
study the approximation of random vectors (via principal component analysis a.k.a. singular value decomposition) and random fields (via Karhunen–
Loève expansion) as well as the approximate separability of the Green’s function of the Helmholtz equation for high frequency
waves. We provide lower bounds and upper bounds for the intrinsic complexity and its asymptotic scaling law.

Title:   Taking Mathematics to Heart
<abstract>
In this presentation I will highlight the interplay between data science and computational science to efficiently solve real life large scale problems . The leading application that I will address is the numerical simulation of the heart function.
The motivation behind this interest is that cardiovascular diseases unfortunately represent one of the leading causes of death in Western Countries.  
Mathematical models based on first principles allow the description of the blood motion in the human circulatory system, as well as the interaction between electrical, mechanical and fluid-dynamical processes occurring in the heart. This is a classical environment where multi-physics processes have to be addressed.
Appropriate numerical strategies can be devised to allow an effective description of the fluid in large and medium size arteries, the analysis of physiological and pathological conditions, and the simulation, control and shape optimization of assisted devices or surgical prostheses.
This presentation will address some of these issues and a few representative applications of clinical interest.

Title: Low rankness in forward and inverse kinetic theory
<abstract>
Multi-scale kinetic equations can be compressed: in certain regimes, the Boltzmann equation is asymptotically equivalent to the Euler equations, and the radiative transfer equation is asymptotically equivalent to the diffusion equation. A lot of detailed information is lost when a system passes to the limit. In linear algebra, it is equivalent to a system being of low rank. I will discuss such transition and how it affects the computation: mainly, in the forward regime, inserting low-rankness could greatly advances the computation, while in the inverse regime, the system being of low rank typically makes the problems significantly harder.

Title: Surveillance-evasion games under uncertainty
<abstract>
Adversarial path planning problems are important in robotics 
applications and in modeling the behavior of humans in dangerous 
environments. Surveillance-Evasion (SE) games form an important subset 
of such problems and require a blend of numerical techniques from 
multiobjective dynamic programming, game theory, numerics for 
Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs, and convex optimization. We model the basic SE 
problem as a semi-infinite zero-sum game between two players: an 
Observer (O) and an Evader (E) traveling through a domain with occluding 
obstacles. O chooses a pdf over a finite set of predefined surveillance 
plans, while E chooses a pdf over an infinite set of trajectories that 
bring it to a target location. The focus of this game is on "E's 
expected cumulative exposure to O", and we have recently developed an 
algorithm for finding the Nash Equilibrium open-loop policies for both 
players. I will use numerical experiments to illustrate algorithmic 
extensions to handle multiple Evaders, moving Observes, and anisotropic 
observation sensors. Time permitting, I will also show preliminary 
results for a very large number of selfish/independent Evaders modeled 
via Mean Field Games.

Title: Automated Modeling with FEniCS
<abstract>
The FEniCS Project develops both fundamental software components
and end-user codes to automate numerical solution of partial
differential equations (PDEs). FEniCS enables users to translate
scientific models quickly into efficient finite element code and
also offers powerful capabilities for more experienced programmers.
FEniCS and other automated software are catalyzing a change for
PDEs similar to the one that Matlab did for linear algebra.

FEniCS uses the variational formulation of PDEs as a language to
define models. We will explain the variational formulations for
simple problems and then show how they can be extended to simulate
fluid flow. The variational formulation also provides a firm
theoretical foundation for understanding PDEs. We argue that
combining the theory with practical coding provides a way to teach
PDEs, their numerical solution, and associated modeling without
requiring extensive mathematical prerequisites. We demonstrate
that this approach requires no background in PDEs or finite
elements, only multi-variate calculus.

FEniCS also provides a productive platform for research. We will
present examples where it has been used to answer questions that
would have required months of programming using traditional
techniques.  We will include topics related to mesh generation.

Title: Stochastic Algorithms for Electromagnetic Problems of Nano-Structures
<abstract>
In this talk, we will present some stochastic algorithms and numerical results for solving electromagnetic problems in  nano-particles and random meta-materials.  Firstly, we will present a path integral Monte Carlo method for computing magnetic polarizability tensors of nano-particles of complex geometries for material sciences applications. The method relies on a Feynman-Kac formula involving reflecting Brown motions (RBMs) and accurate computation of the local time of the RBMs using a random walk-on-spheres technique. Secondly, in order to optimize functional properties of 3-D random meta-materials (MMs), we will present a stochastic representation scheme for random MMs with volume exclusion constrains and given correlations, a fast volume integral equation electromagnetic solver for the scattering of a large number of meta-atoms of typical geometric shapes (cubes, spheres, and ellipses) in layered media, and a procedure to optimize the optical properties of the MMs. A new fast multipole method for 3-D Helmholtz equation for layered media will be presented  based on new multipole expansion (ME) and  multipole to local translation (M2L) operators for layered media Green's functions.

Title: Four “better” ways to solve the Navier-Stokes equations: simulation of Richardson pair dispersion, ensemble discretization methods, an auxiliary equation approach for UQ, and filtered regularizations.
<abstract>
The facetious and self-serving title refers to four approaches for Navier-Stokes simulations. The first involves the analysis, numerical analysis, and an efficient implementation strategy for a recently proposed fractional Laplacian closure model that accounts for Richardson pair dispersion observed in turbulent flows. The second is the exploitation of accurate and widely applicable ensemble methods in settings in which multiple inputs need to be processed, as may be the case for uncertainty quantification, reduced-order modeling, and control and optimization. The third addresses the lack of regularity of solutions and the resultant loss of accuracy of approximations in the case of white or weakly correlated additive noise forcing.  The fourth involves filtered spectral viscosity and hierarchical finite element methods for regularized Navier-Stokes equations.
