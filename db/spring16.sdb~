Title: Homogenization of thermo-mechanical continua using extensive physical quantities: Theory and Simulation
<abstract> 
 The macroscopic thermomechanical behaviour of heterogeneous media may depend strongly on their microstructure. For example, the macroscopic behavior of polycrystals depends on the size and orientation of underlying single crystals. Another situation is the complex rheological behavior of vesicle suspensions. In such cases, the constitutive behavior of the microstructure needs to be considered when modelling the bulk material response.   

In this talk, I will describe a homogenization method to connect the microscopic and macroscopic scales based on extensive physical quantities assuming that both scales can be modeled using continuum mechanics. The method extends to the continuum-on-continuum setting the celebrated approach of Irving & Kirkwood, which forms the basis for upscaling atomistic variables of classical statistical mechanics, such as position, momentum and interatomic forces to continuum variables, such as stress and heat flux. An application of this extended method will be explored within the context of finite element-based homogenization of solids in quasi-static conditions. Finally, I will discuss the microscale inertial or dynamical effects on the macroscale behavior for a 1-dimensional elastic-layered medium.

Title: Diffusion Forecast: A nonparametric modeling approach
<abstract>
I will discuss a nonparametric modeling approach for forecasting stochastic dynamical systems on smooth manifolds embedded in Euclidean space. In the limit of large data, this approach converges to a Galerkin projection of the semigroup solution of the backward Kolmogorov equation of the underlying dynamics on a basis adapted to the invariant measure. This approach allows one to evolve the probability distribution of non-trivial dynamical systems with an equation-free modeling. If time permitted, I will also discuss a semi-parametric modeling framework to compensate for model error by learning an auxiliary dynamical model for the unknown parameters.

Title: Numercial study of artificial microswimmers propelled by Marangoni flow
<abstract>
In order to understand the collective behaviour of biological microswimmers, such as bacteria and spermatozoa, it is important to know which aspects are governed merely by the physics of the system and which aspects are biology-related. In the present study we address the mechanisms of locomotion of non-biological swimmers. We focus on artificial swimmers consisting in active droplets moving by Marangoni flow, in particular nematic liquid crystal droplets immersed in an aqueous solution containing an ionic surfactant, and self-propelled droplets driven by Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions. We numerically study the flow field outside and inside a single droplet, by means of a level set method, in order to account for both the deformation of the droplet and the interaction with a small number of neighbouring droplets. Further mechanisms that influence the locomotion, such as mass transport, chemical reactions and the coupling between the bulk and the surface concentration of the surfactants, are also specifically addressed.

Title: Asynchronous Parallel Computing in Signal Processing and Machine Learning
<abstract>
The performance of each CPU core stopped improving around 2005. The Moore's law, however, continues to apply -- not to single-thread performance -- but the number of cores in each computer. Today, workstations are with 64 cores, graphic cards with thousands of GPU cores, and some cellphones with eight cores are sold at affordable prices. To benefit from this multi-core Moore's law, we must parallelize our algorithms. We study asynchronous parallel computing at a high-level of abstraction: finding a fixed point to a nonexpansive operator. It underlies many models in numerical linear algebra, optimization, and other areas of scientific computing. To solve this problem, we propose ARock, an asynchronous parallel algorithmic framework, in which a set of agents (machines, processors, or cores) update randomly selected coordinates of the unknown variable in an asynchronous parallel fashion. As special cases of ARock, novel algorithms for linear equation systems, machine learning, distributed and decentralized optimization are introduced. We show that if the nonexpansive operator has a fixed point, then with probability one the sequence of points generated by ARock converges to a fixed point. Convergence rates are also given. Very encouraging numerical performance of ARock is observed on sparse logistic regression and other large-scale problems. This is joint work with Zhimin Peng (UCLA), Yangyang Xu (IMA), and Ming Yan (Michigan State).

Title: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms for Large Eigenvalue Problems
<abstract>
Quantum computation has the potential to dramatically speed up the solution to a number of important problems in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Unfortunately, many quantum algorithms are infeasible on current and near-term quantum devices. In this talk, I will show how combining classical and quantum resources allows one to maximally utilize available quantum resources in the solution of eigenvalue problems, with a particular emphases on quantum chemical applications. Moreover, this approach will help to highlight the origin of a potential quantum speedup over classical calculations. The talk will be designed to appeal to a broad mathematical audience and will not assume an extensive background in quantum mechanics.

Title:Continuous Data Assimilation for Geophysical Models Employing Coarse Mesh Observables
<abstract>
One of the main characteristics of infinite-dimensional dissipative evolution equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, is that their long-time dynamics is determined by finitely many parameters -- a finite number of determining modes, nodes, volume elements and other determining interpolants. In this talk I will show how to explore this finite-dimensional feature of the long-time behavior of infinite-dimensional dissipative systems to design finite-dimensional feedback control for stabilizing their solutions. Notably, it is observed that this very same approach can be implemented for designing data assimilation algorithms for  weather prediction based on discrete measurements. In addition, I will also show that the long-time dynamics of the Navier-Stokes equations can be imbedded in an infinite-dimensional dynamical system that is induced by an ordinary differential equation, named determining form, which is governed by a globally Lipschitz vector field. The Navier-Stokes equations are used as an illustrative example, and all the above mentioned results equally hold for other dissipative evolution PDEs, in particular for various dissipative geophysical models.

Title: Ergodicity in data assimilation methods
<abstract>
The prototypical data assimilation problem has an enormous number of variables that evolve according to a complex and unpredictable dynamical system. The challenge for scientists has been to find computationally efficient methods for sequentially assimilating observed data and models, with the aim of guiding the state predictions towards the observations. 

Despite their widespread use, most data assimilation methods remain mechanistically mysterious - there are few guarantees that the dynamical properties of the method will resemble those of the underlying physical model. One might for instance anticipate that a successful data assimilation method will inherit ergodicity from the underlying model, so that if the model is statistically stable to initial perturbations then the method will be similarly stable. 

In this talk we will introduce some data assimilation methods that are commonly implemented in geoscience and discuss the above mentioned question of stability. Using the framework of ergodicity for Markov processes, we find sufficient conditions for the inheritance of ergodicity. As a counterpoint, we will construct a simple model that highlights the propensity of data assimilation algorithms to fail spectacularly when it comes to inheritance of ergodicity.

Title: Enhancing Sparsity in Uncertainty Quantification Problems by Iterative Rotations 
<abstract>
Compressive sensing has become a powerful addition to uncertainty quantification
in recent years. We propose a new method to identify new bases for random variables through
linear mappings such that the representation of the quantity of interest is more sparse with new
basis functions associated with the new random variables. This sparsity increases both the 
efficiency and accuracy of the compressive sensing-based uncertainty quantification method. 
Specifically, we consider rotation-based linear mappings which are determined iteratively for
Hermite polynomial expansions. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method with uncertainty 
quantification problems in PDEs and biomolecular systems.

Title: A space-time discontinuous-Galerkin spectral element method for compressible flows
<abstract>
High-Reynolds number separated flows involve large-scale unsteady motion which require scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in order to provide accurate predictions. Higher-order methods have been shown to be more efficient for simulations requiring high spatial and temporal resolution, allowing for solutions with fewer degrees of freedom and lower computational cost than traditional second-order CFD methods. A higher-order space-time discontinuous-Galerkin(DG) method is presented for the scale-resolving simulation of high-Reynolds number compressible flows. The space-time DG method is implemented efficiently using a tensor-product formulation and solved with a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov scheme and tensor-product based preconditioners. The effect of the discrete formulation on the nonlinear stability of the scheme is assessed through numerical simulations. With increasing Reynolds number, it is shown that an entropy-stable formulation is required in order to maintain stability at high-order. Using an entropy variable formulation consistent with established entropy stability theory ensures nonlinear stability at high and infinite Reynolds number.  Numerical results are presented demonstrating the success of the method on a variety of subsonic compressible flows.

Title: Tensor networks and hierachcial tensors for  quantum phyiscs and more 
<abstract>
Approximation by sum of products (of uni-variate functions) is a widely used,
e.g. in statistics and physics,  concept to approximate high dimensional
functions, and high-dimensional problems, e.g. PDE's  are cast into optimzation
problems.  However,   the non-linear parametrization leads to problems, where
the most  simplest are  shown to be NP hard (Hillard-Lim 2012).  For a
particular class of multi-linear parametrizations, namely hierarchical
tensor representations (Hackbusch et al.  2009) or  tree tensor networks,
these difficulties can be resolved to a fairely wide extent, and provide a
mathematically sound concept for tensor product approximation.  Hierarchcial
tensors will be   introduced by  a hierarchy of optimal subspace
approximations, and demostrated by tensor trains (TT), resp. 
matrix products states (MPS).    

We treat  different applications ranging  from  quantum chemistry, Langevin
dynamics of biomolecules,  uncertainty quantification to tensor completion  by
variant of  DMRG (density  matrix renormalization group) and improved
algorithm.
