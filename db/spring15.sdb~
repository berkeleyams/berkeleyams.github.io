Title: What are the Navier-Stokes equations of sand flow? Some challenges in theoretical and computational continuum mechanics

<abstract> 
The challenge of predicting the flow behavior of a collection of grains has proven to be a difficult one, from both computational and theoretical perspectives.  Unlike Newtonian fluids or linear elastic solids, a continuum model representing the effect of millions of particles interacting through dissipative, frictional contacts has remained a largely open endeavor since it was first considered by Coulomb in the late 1700's.  Brute force grain-by-grain discrete element methods can be used, but these approaches become computationally unrealistic for large bodies of material and long times. 

In this talk we propose a new, nonlocal continuum relation for granular matter, which is shown to predict granular flow and stress fields in hundreds of different geometries.  The model is constructed in a step-by-step fashion.  First a local, elasto-visoplastic flow relation is derived based on the principle of inertial scaling.  The clearest missing ingredient is shown to be the lack of an intrinsic length-scale to represent the cooperativity that a finite grain size asserts on the flow.  We account for this with a carefully justified implicit-nonlocal term, which introduces a single new material parameter, and converts the flow rule into a separate PDE that couples directly with the momentum balance PDE.  The model is numerically implemented with a custom finite-element scheme.   Under a single parameter calibration, the nonlocal model quantitatively predicts the flow and stress data from ~200 experiments of spherical bead systems in several different families of geometries.  Moreover, it is the first model to accurately predict all features of flows in "split-bottom cells", a decade-long open problem in the field. We show that the same model also reconciles other "unusual"  features of granular media, such as the observation that thinner granular layers behave as if they are stronger, and the motion-induced quicksand effect wherein flow at one location eliminates the yield stress everywhere.

Title: A variational perspective on wrinkling patterns in thin elastic sheets
<abstract> 
Thin sheets exhibit a daunting array of patterns. A key difficulty in
their analysis is that while we have many examples, we have no classification of the possible "patterns." I have explored an alternative viewpoint in a series of recent projects with Peter Bella, Hoai-Minh Nguyen, and others. Our goal is to identify the *scaling law* of the minimum elastic energy (with respect to the sheet thickness, and the other parameters of the problem). Success requires proving upper bounds and lower bounds that scale the same way. The upper bounds are usually easier, since nature gives us a hint. The lower bounds are more subtle, since they
must be ansatz-independent. In many cases, the arguments used to
prove the lower bounds help explain "why" we see particular patterns.
My talk will give an overview of this activity, and details of some examples.

Title: Topologically protected edge states in continuous two-dimensional honeycomb structures
<abstract>
An edge state is a time-harmonic mode of a conservative wave system, 
e.g. Schroedinger, Maxwell, which is propagating (plane-wave-like) parallel to and localized, 
transverse to a line-defect or ``edge”.  
Topologically protected edge states are edge states which are immune to local scattering impurities.

First studied in the context of the quantum Hall effect, protected edge states 
have attracted great interest recently due to their role in the field of topological insulators.
Such states are potential vehicles for robust energy-transfer
in the presence of strong localized defects and random imperfections.
They are therefore considered ideal for use in nano-scale devices.

The theoretical understanding of topological protection
has mainly come from discrete (tight-binding) models and direct numerical simulation. 
 
After an introduction to the spectral properties of continuous honeycomb structures 
and their novel properties such as Dirac points, we introduce a rich family of continuum
PDE models and discuss regimes  (``phases") where topologically protected edge states exist 
along a ``zig-zag edge", and regimes where edge states may exist but are not protected.
 
These results follow from a general theorem on the bifurcation of edge states from Dirac points 
of the background honeycomb structure. This bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of an effective Dirac equation.
The key to applying the general theorem is the verification of a spectral no-fold condition along the zig-zag edge.

This is joint work with C.L. Fefferman and J.P. Lee-Thorp.

Title: Analysis of the Pollution Effect in Finite Element Discretization of Highly Heterogeneous Helmholtz Problems
<abstract>
Time harmonic waves, modeled by the Helmholtz equation, are used in several engineering processes including, for instance, radar and seismic imaging. In the context of seismic imaging, waves propagate through the earth, which can be represented (in the simplest case) as an heterogeneous acoustic medium. Depending on the application, the simulation of high-frequency waves can be required, especially for high-resolution imaging. Numerical approximation of high-frequency waves is a challenging problem, even in homogeneous media. Indeed, numerical approximations suffer from the so-called pollution effect: if the number of discretization points per wave length is kept constant, the numerical solution diverges from the best approximation the scheme is capable of when the frequency is increasing. As a result, drastic conditions are imposed on the mesh at high frequency: the number of points per wave length must be increased when the frequency increases. In the case of homogeneous media, it has been shown (and observed numerically) that high order methods are able to reduce the pollution effect, making them cheaper than low order methods to solve for high-frequency. However, the application of high order methods to highly heterogeneous media is not trivial. It turns out that high order methods are build on coarser meshes, so that they do not capture fine scale variations of the propagation medium if the parameters are taken to be constant in each cell. The aim of this work is the study of a multiscale medium approximation strategy for high order methods. We propose a theoretical analysis of the pollution effect in the context of multiscale medium approximation when using polynomial shape functions and we present numerical experiments (including geophysical benchmarks).

Title: Introduction to Gradient-weighted Moving Finite Elements
<abstract>
GWMFE is especially suited to PDE problems with sharp moving fronts.  The moving nodes tend to concentrate and move with the fronts, allowing far fewer nodes and much larger timesteps. It does this by treating the solution as an evolving manifold and discretizes with an evolving piecewise linear manifold. I will explain the variational and mechanical interpretations of GWMFE, our BDF2 stiff ODE solver,and our nonlinear Krylov solver for the implicit equations. I will show 2D graphics for the Shallow Water Equations, for Normal and Vertical Motion by Mean Curvature, for the Stefan Problem for melting ice, and also an example from Neil Carlson's 3D GWMFE code. I will discuss the necessity of adding global adaptivity to our codes (insertion and deletion of nodes, flipping edges) and my largely unsuccessful search for "stabilized" versions of MFE which prevent nodes from drifting with the flow in transient advection problems.

Title: Phase-field models for multiphase complex fluids: modeling, numerical analysis and simulations
<abstract>
I shall present some recent work on phase-field model for multiphase incompressible flows. We shall pay particular attention to situations with large density ratios as they lead to formidable challenges in both analysis and simulation.

I shall present unconditionally energy stable, decoupled  numerical schemes which only require solving a sequence of linear elliptic equations at each time step for solving this coupled nonlinear system, and show ample numerical results which not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical schemes, but also validate the flexibility and robustness of the phase-field model.

Title: Adaptive finite element methods for turbulent flow and fluid-structure interaction with applications in aerodynamics and biomedicine
<abstract>
We present adaptive finite element methods to compute weak solutions to
the Navier-Stokes equations, which are used to simulate turbulent fluid
flow. The mesh is adaptively refined with respect to output functionals of
the weak solutions, such as lift or drag of an airplane, and we observe
convergence in such functionals as the mesh is refined. The adaptive
method is based on the computation of an adjoint (or dual) problem to
derive a posteriori estimates of the error in a functional, which guides
the mesh refinement algorithms. We also present a monolithic method for
solving fluid-structure interaction problems. The numerical methods are
implemented as part of the open source software FEniCS, and we show
applications of the technology including the aerodynamics of airplanes and
biomechanics of the human voice and the human heart.

Title: Statistical Data Assimilation: Path Integrals and Approximations
<abstract>
Formulating statistical data assimilation with noisy measurements and model errors as a path integral over the path of a model state during a temporal observation window holds advantages over existing variational principles in data assimilation: two of these are in a framework where corrections to the variational methods can be evaluated and in an approach to identifying the minimum of the variational objective function. Examples from nonlinear models using in geophysics and neurobiology will be given as well an example from analysis of laboratory experiments on neurons in the songbird vocalization system.

Title: Coarsening of Particle Systems
<abstract> 
Each particle in a simulation of a system of particles usually
represents a huge number of real particles. We present a framework for
constructing the dynamics for the so-called coarsened system of
simulated particles. We build an approximate solution to the Liouville
equation for the original system from the solution of an equation for
the phase-space density of a smaller system. We do this with a Markov
approximation in a Mori-Zwanzig formalism based on a reference density.
We then identify the evolution equation for the reduced phase-space
density as the forward Kolmogorov equation of a Markov process. The
original system governed by deterministic dynamics is then simulated
with the coarsened system governed by this Markov process. Both Monte
Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be view from
this framework. More generally, the reduced dynamics can have elements
of both MC and MD.
