Title: Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems: Theory and Applications
<abstract>
Vibrations are everywhere, and so are the eigenvalues that describe
them. Physical models that include involve damping, delay, or
radiation often lead to nonlinear eigenvalue problems, in which we
seek complex values for which an (analytic) matrix-valued function is
singular. In this talk, we show how to generalize eigenvalue
localization results, such as Gershgorin's theorem, Bauer-Fike, and
pseudospectral theorems, to the nonlinear case. We demonstrate the
usefulness of our results on examples from delay differential
equations and quantum resonances.

Title: Nonequilibrium stochastic processes at single-molecule and single-cell levels
<abstract>
Stochastic process has a glorious history in physics, chemistry and biology. Due to the advance of single-molecule techniques, stochastic modeling and computation become more and more useful and popular recently. I will talk about several different issues related to stochastic processes at single-molecule and single-cell levels, including stochastic theory of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, the uncover of the molecular mechanism of transcriptional burst, and the fluctuating-rate model as well as the rate formula for the phenotype transition in an intermediate scenario of a single cell. A series of problems in applied mathematics could also arise from stochastic processes in physics, chemistry and biology.

Title: Sparse Factorizations and Scalable Algorithms for Differential and Integral Operators
<abstract>
This talk focus on the Distributed-memory hierarchical interpolative factorization (DHIF) which offers an efficient way for solving or preconditioning elliptic partial differential equations. By exploiting locality and low-rank properties of the operators, the DHIF achieves quasi-linear complexity for factorizing the discrete positive definite elliptic operator and linear complexity for solving the associated linear system. The DHIF organizes the processes in a hierarchical structure and keep the communication as local as possible.  The computation complexity is O(N log N / P) and O( N / P ) for constructing and applying the DHIF, respectively, where N is the size of the problem and P is the number of processes. Extensive numerical examples are performed on the NERSC Edison system with up to 8192 processes. The numerical results agree with the complexity analysis and demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the DHIF.

Title: Coarse grained density functional theory for the study of defects in crystalline materials
<abstract>
Defects determine critical properties of crystalline materials even though they occur at relatively low concentrations.  They can interact over long distances through slowly decaying fields whose strength depends on the electronic structure of the core.  Thus the study of defects requires electronic resolutions with continuum range.  This talk will describe some of the mathematical and computational challenges that arise, and outline a sub-linear scaling method for computing the electronic structure of solids at continuum scales.

Title: Twisted X-rays, orbital angular momentum and the determination of atomic structure
<abstract>
After a general introduction to our work on “objective structures”, we focus on Maxwell’s equations.  We find solutions of Maxwell’s equations that are the precise analog of plane waves, but in the case that the translation group is replaced by the (largest) Abelian helical group.  These waves display constructive/destructive interference with helical atomic structures, in the same way that plane waves interact with crystals. We show how the resulting far-field pattern can be used for structure determination, and we test the idea theoretically on the Pf1 virus from the Protein Data Bank.  The underlying mathematical idea of this and our related work is always the same: the structure of interest is the orbit of a group, and this group is an invariance group of the differential equations.  Joint work with Dominik Juestel and Gero Friesecke (SIAM J. Applied Math 76 and Acta Cryst. A72).

Title: Fluid-composite structure interaction and blood flow
<abstract>
Fluid-structure interaction problems with composite structures arise in many applications. One example is the interaction between blood flow and arterial walls. Arterial walls are composed of several layers, each with different mechanical characteristics and thickness. No mathematical results exist so far that analyze existence of solutions to nonlinear, fluid-structure interaction problems in which the structure is composed of several layers. In this talk we will summarize the main difficulties in studying this class of problems, and present a computational scheme based on which a proof of the existence of a weak solution was obtained. Our results reveal a new physical regularizing mechanism in FSI problems: inertia of the thin fluid-structure interface with mass regularizes evolution of FSI solutions. Implications of our theoretical results on modeling the human cardiovascular system will be discussed.

This is a joint work with Boris Muha (University of Zagreb, Croatia), Martina
Bukac (U of Notre Dame, US) and Roland Glowinski (UH). Numerical results with
vascular stents were obtained with S. Deparis and D. Forti (EPFL, Switzerland).
Collaboration with medical doctors Dr. S. Little (Methodist Hospital Houston) and Dr. Z. Krajcer (Texas Heart Institute) is also acknowledged.
