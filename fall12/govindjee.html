<p>In the operation of high frequency resonators in micro electromechanical
systems (MEMS) there is a strong need to be able to accurately determine the
energy loss rates or alternatively the quality of the resonance. The resonance
quality is directly related to a designerâ€™s ability to assemble high fidelity
system response for signal filtering, for example. This has implications on
robustness and quality of electronic communication and also strongly influences
overall rates of power consumption in such devices &ndash; <i>i.e.</i> battery life. Past
design work was highly focused on the design of single resonators; this arena
of work has now given way to active efforts at the design and construction of
arrays of coupled resonators. The behavior of such systems in the laboratory
shows un-necessarily large spread in operational characteristics, which are
thought to be the result of manufacturing variations. However, such statements
are difficult to prove due to a lack of available methods for predicting
resonator damping &ndash; even the single resonator problem is difficult. The
physical problem requires the modeling of the behavior of a resonant structure
(or set of structures) supported by an elastic half-space. The half-space
(chip) serves as a physical support for the structure but also as a path for
energy loss. Other loss mechanisms can of course be important but in the
regime of interest for us, loss of energy through the anchoring support of the
structure to the chip is the dominant effect. 
</p><p>
The construction of a basic discretized model of such a system leads to a
system of equations with complex-symmetric (not Hermitian) structure. The
complex-symmetry arises from the introduction of a radiation boundary
conditions to handle the semi-infinite character of the half-space region.
Requirements of physical accuracy dictate rather fine discretization and,
thusly, large systems of equations. The core to the extraction of relevant
physical performance parameters is dependent upon the underlying modeling
framework. Notwithstanding, in two-dimensions it is possible to utilize
eignenvalue methods with direct solvers to effectively determine quantities of
interest. However, in three dimensional settings of practical interest, such
systems are too large to be handled directly and must be solved iteratively;
alternate time-stepping methods in conjuction with harmonic inversion thus
start to look attractive. In this talk, I will cover the physical background of
the problem class of interest, how such systems can be modeled, and then
solved. Particular interest will be paid to the radiation boundary conditions
(perfectly matched layers versus higher order absorbing boundary conditions),
issues associated with frequency domain versus time domain methods, and how
these choices interact with iterative solver technologies in sometimes
unexpected ways.
