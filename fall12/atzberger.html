<h4 class="top">Hydrodynamics of Lipid Bilayer Membranes</h4>
<h5><b>Paul Atzberger, UC Santa Barbara</b></h5>

<p>Lipid bilayer membranes play a fundamental role in cell biology serving diverse
roles ranging from compartmentalising cells into distinct regions across which
chemical gradients are maintained to serving as scaffolds on which many
proteins anchor and aggregate. Understanding basic features of these complex
soft materials presents many interesting problems and challenges. Lipids are
amphilic molecules having hydrophobic&ndash;hydrophilic domains and exhibit
intriguing phases and collective behaviours such as self-assembly into fluidic
structures such as micelles, vesicles, and membrane sheets. In the dynamic
responses of these materials, hydrodynamics of the surrounding solvent often
plays an important role in coupling both motions of the individual lipids of
the bilayer and the lateral motions of protein inclusions. In this talk we
shall address primarily this hydrodynamic aspect and related phenomena by
introducing new mathematical and computational approaches for the study of
lipid bilayer membrane sheets and vesicles. In particular, we shall present
results for a continuum mechanics description of lipid bilayer membranes that
accounts for how protein inclusions alter local material properties taking into
account the bi-directional membrane&ndash;protein coupling, solvent hydrodynamics,
and membrane thermal undulations. At the molecular level, we shall discuss a
new dynamic coarse-grained modelling approach for lipids that treats the
solvent implicitly but incorporates the important roles played by hydrodynamics
and thermal fluctuations through a numerical fluctuating hydrodynamics method.
We will then present specific results of this approach for lipid bilayer
membrane sheets and vesicles.
