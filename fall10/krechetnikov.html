<h4 class="top">Dissipation-induced instabilities</h4>
<h5><b>Rouslan Krechetnikov, UC Santa Barbara</b></h5>
<h5>September 15th, 2010 at 4PM&ndash;5PM in 939 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>In this talk a joint work with Jerrold Marsden on a theory of the
counter-intuitive phenomena of dynamical destabilization under the action of
dissipation is presented. While the existence of one class of
dissipation-induced instabilities in finite-dimensional mechanical systems was
known to Lord Kelvin, until recently it has not been realized that there is
another major type of these phenomena hinted by one of theorems due to
mechanician Merkin; in fact, these two cases exhaust all the generic
possibilities in finite dimensions. We put the main theoretical achievements in
a general context of geometric mechanics, thus unifying the current knowledge
in this area and the multitude of relevant physical problems scattered over a
vast literature.
</p><p>
Next we develop a rigorous notion of dissipation-induced instability in the
infinite-dimensional case, which inherent differences from classical finite
degree of freedom mechanical systems make uncovering this concept more
intricate. In building this concept of dissipation-induced instability we found
Arnold's and Yudovich's nonlinear stability methods, for conservative and
dissipative systems respectively, along with some new existence theory for
solutions to be the essential ingredients. As a paradigm and the first
infinite-dimensional example to be carefully analyzed, we use a two-layer
quasi-geostrophic beta-plane model, which describes the fundamental baroclinic
instability in atmospheric and ocean dynamics.
