<h4 class="top">Swimming and Flying at Low and Intermediate Reynolds Numbers</h4>
<h5><b>Saverio Spagnolie, UC San Diego</b></h5>

<p>Many microorganisms propel themselves through fluids by passing either helical
waves (typically prokaryotes) or planar waves (typically eukaryotes) along a
filamentous flagellum. Both from a biological and an engineering perspective,
it is of great interest to understand the role of the waveform shape in
determining an organism's locomotive kinematics, as well as its hydrodynamic
efficiency. For eukaryotic flagella, a famous sawtoothed solution due to
Lighthill can be regularized when energetic costs of internal bending and
axonemal sliding are included in a classical measure of hydrodynamic
efficiency. We will then discuss locomotion optimization for bacterial
swimming, and compare experimentally measured biological data on swimming
bacteria and optimization results from accurate numerical simulations. Finally,
the locomotive dynamics of bodies at intermediate Reynolds numbers will be
discussed, where a number of surprising and counter-intuitive behaviors can be
seen even in very simple systems. The dynamics of a flapping wing with passive
pitching will be explored, which we have studied experimentally and
numerically, having constructed a high-order accurate numerical scheme to solve
the full Navier-Stokes equations in two-dimensions. By increasing the flapping
frequency we find regions of improved performance when compared to a
non-pitching wing, regions of under-performance, and a bi-stable regime where
the flapping wing can move horizontally in either direction.
