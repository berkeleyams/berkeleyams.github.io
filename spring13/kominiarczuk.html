<p>We present a method for sampling high-dimensional probability spaces,
applicable to Markov fields with both discrete and continuous variables, based
on an approximate acyclic representation of the probability density. Our method
generalizes and places in a common framework some recent work on computing
renormalized Hamiltonians and stochastic multigrid sampling.
</p><p>
An acyclic representation of a probability distribution function (PDF) is
obtained when one chooses an ordering of the variables and writes the PDF as a
product of conditional probabilities, so that the probability of any variable
is conditional only on the variables that precede it in the ordering. An
acyclic representation makes the sampling efficient, because it uses the
sparsity present in the model. We derive an approximate acyclic representation
for general graphs by finding marginals through a fast marginalization scheme.
The partial derivatives of the logarithm of the marginal probability are
computed approximately through stochastic linear projection onto a polynomial
basis, followed by reconstruction of the marginal through integration.  The
projection is based on an optimized inner product, making possible the use of
Gaussian quadrature. Probability distributions involving discrete variables are
handled by embedding the PDFs in differentiable extensions. Our algorithm can
be extended to the evaluation of renormalized Hamiltonians formed using general
renormalization schemes.
</p><p>
The approximate acyclic representation of the PDF is then used for sampling.
The variables are sampled in a fixed order, producing independent samples
together with their sampling weights. We present an optimized sampling strategy
that uses a maximum amount of information to choose individual variable values.
The samples are further improved using techniques from particle filtering. We
also introduce a block Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on the sampling
weights. Finally, we present applications of our methodology to lattice
models: the Ising model and the Edwards&ndash;Anderson spin glass.
