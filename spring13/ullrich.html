<h4 class="top">Understanding the treatment of waves in atmospheric models: The shortest resolved waves of the linear wave equation</h4>
<h5><b>Paul Ullrich, UC Davis</b></h5>
<h5>February 20th, 2013 at 4PM&ndash;5PM in 939 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>To a close approximation, the atmosphere is in a state of geostrophic and
hydrostatic balance. For atmospheric flows, departures from geostrophy are
approximately linear. The Mach number of these flows is generally much less
than one, and shock waves are not present. In this regime, the dynamical
character of the fluid is dominated by wave motion. As a result, the correct
treatment of linear waves is intrinsic to any accurate approach for modeling
the equations of motion.
</p><p>
This talk provides an intercomparison of the dispersive and diffusive
properties of several standard numerical methods as applied to the linear wave
equation, including upwind and central finite-volume, spectral finite-volume,
discontinuous Galerkin, spectral element, and staggered finite-volume. All
methods are studied up to tenth-order accuracy, where possible. A consistent
framework is developed which allows for direct intercomparison of the ability
of these methods to capture the behavior of wave-like motions. The goal of this
work is threefold: first, to determine the shortest wavelength which can be
considered &#8220;resolved&#8221; for a particular method; second, to determine the
effect of increasing the order of accuracy on the ability of a method to
capture wave-like motion; third, to determine which numerical methods offer the
best treatment of wave-like motion.
