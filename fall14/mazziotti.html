<p>Semidefinite programming is an important generalization of linear programming in which linear inequalities are replaced by linear matrix inequalities [1]. In this lecture we will examine the application of semidefinite programming in quantum chemistry to describe weakly and strongly correlated quantum systems. We will focus on the computation of one- and two-electron reduced density matrices (1- and 2-RDMs) for the study of mean-field behavior and strong correlation in molecules and materials, respectively [2]. By expressing mean-field calculations as semidefinite programs , we can compute upper and lower bounds on the Hartree-Fock energy [3]. When these upper and lower bounds are equal, they provide a polynomial-time calculation of the global Hartree-Fock energy. Semidefinite programs using the 2-RDM as the basic variable can treat strongly correlated electrons at a polynomial computational cost with applications from hydrocarbon chemistry to bioluminescence [2]. We will also examine how measurement-driven reconstruction of quantum processes can be performed with semidefinite programming [4]. Information about many-particle systems can be extracted from experimental data in the form of 1- or 2-RDMs. Finally, we will discuss how a generalization of the Pauli exclusion principle defines a convex polytope of pure 1-RDMs that are derivable from a single wave function. By studying only the relation of a systemâ€™s 1-RDM to the boundary of this set, we can address the significant question of whether a quantum system is open or closed to interactions with its environment [5].
