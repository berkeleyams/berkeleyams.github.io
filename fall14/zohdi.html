<p>Recently, several manufacturing applications have arisen that involve the dynamic of response of particulate systems  in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. In many  cases, there is significant multifield coupling, which  requires methods that can capture the unique and essential physics of these systems. In this presentation, I discuss the modeling and simulation of three  such applications:
</p><p>
(1) Electromagnetic composites, with applications motivated  by strongly coupled electromagnetic and  thermo-mechanical  fields that arise in particulate-doped materials from Joule heating, which alter the pointwise dielectric  properties such as the electric permittivity,  magnetic permeability, and electric conductivity, hence affecting  the overall material response.
</p><p>
(2) Charged particulate jet sprays and droplets, with applications motivated  by microtechnology  (electrostatic copiers, inkjet printers, powder coating machines  and a variety of small-scale manufacturing processes), where a successful analysis requires the simulation of flowing particulate media  involving  simultaneous near-field  interaction between charged particles and  momentum  exchange through thermo-mechanical contact.
</p><p>
(3) Rapid, energy-efficient, sintering  of materials comprised of heterogeneous powders, which  is of critical importance in emerging technologies where traditional manufacturing  processes may be  difficult to apply, with specific applications to  electrically-aided sintering,  which utilizes the material's  inherent resistance to flowing current, resulting in Joule-heating to bond the powder components. The process has great promise, since it produces desired materials without  much post-processing. Furthermore, it has advantages over other methods, such as high purity of processed materials, in particular since there are   few steps during the approach. Additionally, simulation of selective Laser-assisted sintering and ablation is discussed.
