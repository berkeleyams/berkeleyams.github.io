<h4 class="top">Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Rigorous Data-Driven Computation of Spectral Properties of Koopman Operators for Dynamical Systems</h4>

<p>Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that globally linearize
nonlinear dynamical systems, making their spectral information valuable for
understanding dynamics. However, Koopman operators can have continuous
spectra, can lack finite-dimensional invariant subspaces, and approximations can
suffer from spectral pollution (spurious modes). These issues make computing
the spectral properties of Koopman operators a considerable challenge. This two-
part talk will detail the first scheme (ResDMD) with convergence guarantees for
computing the spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators from
snapshot data. Furthermore, we use the resolvent operator and ResDMD to
compute smoothed approximations of spectral measures (including continuous
spectra), with explicit high-order convergence. ResDMD is similar to extended
DMD, except it rigorously concurrently computes a residual from the same
snapshot data, allowing practitioners to gain confidence in the computed results.
Kernelized variants of our algorithms allow for dynamical systems with a high-
dimensional state-space, and the error control provided by ResDMD allows a
posteriori verification of learnt dictionaries. We apply ResDMD to compute the
spectral measure associated with the dynamics of a protein molecule (20,046-dimensional state-space) and demonstrate several problems in fluid dynamics
(with state-space dimensions > 100,000). For example, we compare ResDMD
and DMD for particle image velocimetry data from turbulent wall-jet flow, the
acoustic signature of laser-induced plasma, and turbulent flow past a cascade of
aerofoils.
