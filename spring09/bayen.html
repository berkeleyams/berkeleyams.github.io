<h4 class="top">Construction of lower semi continuous solutions to the Hamilton&ndash;Jacobi equation with internal boundary conditions: application to highway traffic monitoring</h4>
<h5><b>Alex Bayen, UC Berkeley Civil and Environmental Engineering</b></h5>
<h5>February 20th, 2009 at 11AM&ndash;12PM in 939 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>This talk describes the construction of lower semi continuous solutions to a
specific class of Hamilton&#8211;Jacobi equations with concave Hamiltonians.
The problem is posed as a capture basin problem, in which the target is defined
in epigraphical form to encode the boundary and initial conditions of the
problem.  The solution is computed through its epigraph, which is the capture
basin of the target under a set valued dynamics involving the Fenchel transform
of the Hamiltonian. The resulting solution is a Barron&#8211;Jensen /
Frankowska solution, which is lower semi continuous. The target is generalized
to functions which enable one to include conditions inside the domain (internal
boundary conditions), which in the context of traffic engineering can be
interpreted as vehicle trajectories. A Lax&#8211;Hopf formula enables the
computation of the solutions, which can be carried out explicitly in the case
of piecewise affine conditions.</p>

<p>The resulting algorithms are applied to the problem of Lagrangian data
assimilation for hydrodynamic models of traffic. Results from experimental
deployments in California and New York will be also presented, as well as
preliminary results from the Mobile Millennium field operational test in
California
(<a href="http://traffic.berkeley.edu/">http://traffic.berkeley.edu</a>),
which is planned to reach 10,000 probe vehicles in a few months.</p>
