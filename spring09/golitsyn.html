<h4 class="top">Is our global warming anthropogenic?</h4>
<h5><b>Georgy Golitsyn, A. M. Obukhov Institute for Atmospheric Physics</b></h5>
<h5>February 27th, 2009 at 11AM&ndash;12PM in 939 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>The talk will follow several US NRC reports starting with 1979 and IPCC FAR
(Fourth Assesment Report, 2007) added by personal and Russian experience with
minimum slides. In 1906&#8211;2005 the annual mean global temperature has
increased by 0.74&nbsp;&deg;C&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.33&nbsp;&deg;F, with more than half
increase during last third of the century. Such rapid changes are unknown in
the Earth's history Examples. Cooling of the winter stratosphere and mesosphere
by 10&nbsp;&deg;C&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;30&nbsp;&deg;C is another example of the
global change since IGY, 1957. The 1990s were the decade of mitigation and
prevention of natural catastrophes. During this period losses from catastrophes
of geophysical origin: earthquakes, volcanoes, etc. were more or less level
while the losses from the ones of meteorological origin nearly doubled.</p>

<p>The main greenhouse gas, GHG, in our climate system is water vapour, then
rated by their effects are CO<sub>2</sub>, methane, CFCs, O<sub>3</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O, etc. The GHG-effect is that the atmosphere is more transparent
to the incoming solar radiation than to outgoing thermal IR. When IR opacity
increases then part of the additionally absorbed IR is radiated back warming up
the surface. There is the antiGHG-effect, dust storms on Mars and here,
&#8220;nuclear winter&#8221; (solar radiation is absorbed more by the
atmosphere than surface IR).</p>

<p>Thermodynamics: Clapeyron&#8211;Clausius equation,
<i>e<sub>s</sub></i>(&tau;) - exponential, the warming of the water surface
increases atmospheric water vapour: chief positive feedback, clouds are mostly
negative feedback: US DOE ARM Program. Aerosol: dust volcanic, organic, human
made.</p>

<p>Residence times. Models: solar, IR, aerosol, etc. Climate &#8211; statistics
of weathers. ECMRWF: 512 harmonics, &sim;50 levels in the vertical, 10 day
forecast is mean of 10 forecasts from tiny different initial conditions, a
hundred teraflop computers. Climate change models &sim;42,84 harmonics, &sim;20
levels in the vertical, ocean-better resolution. Parameterizations: expression
of subgrid processes through variables computed at the grid, e.g. air&#8211;sea
interaction.</p>

<p>Model sensitivities. Test of the model performance: XX century,
1950&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;u/p: reanalysis of global weather maps, every 6 hours,
several levels. PDF for vortices on (<i>&delta;p</i>)&sup2;, geostrophy,
exponential, but different for cyclones and anticyclones at high tails,
hurricanes PDF also exponential, as well as tornadoes and dust devils.</p>

<p>Model prediction: in warmer climate more intense hydrological cycle, but
less rain days more days with intense rains, i.e. more probability for both
droughts and floods (Vladimir Semenov, IAP and Kiel). Found for US by Pavel
Groisman (NCC Ashville, N.C.)</p>

<p>Solar activity: <i>&delta;T</i>&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;0.2&nbsp;&deg;C.</p>

<p>Paleoevidence: 7 ice ages, holocene optimum <i>&Delta;T</i> &sim; 1 &deg;C
but for several hundred years, not in Tasmania, never high trends global or
regional? Little ice age 1640&#8211;1820, more regional. 20000&nbsp;y&nbsp;BP
<i>&Delta;T</i>&nbsp;&sim;&nbsp;&minus;5&nbsp;&deg;C,
10000&nbsp;yr&nbsp;-&nbsp;5&nbsp;&deg;C &#8211; 0.05 &deg;C/100&nbsp;yr.</p>

<p>Cretaceous 120&#8211;60&nbsp;MyBP:
<i>&Delta;T</i>&nbsp;&sim;&nbsp;+5&nbsp;&deg;C, warm Arctic + Siberia, due to
CO<sub>2</sub>. 55&nbsp;My&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;100&nbsp;ky,
<i>&Delta;T</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+&nbsp;several&nbsp;&deg;C, due to CH<sub>4</sub>
sudden release.</p>

<p>Main aims: regional changes with better models, PDFs for anomalies as TC,
PL, tornadoes, etc. Many better specialists in particular areas are in US!</p>
