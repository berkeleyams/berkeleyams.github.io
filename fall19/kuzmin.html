<h4 class="top">Algebraic flux correction for finite element discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws</h4>
<h5><b>Dmitri Kuzmin, TU Dortmund University</b></h5>
<h5>10/31, 2019 at 11:00AM&ndash;12:00PM in Evans 891</h5>
<p>In this talk, we review some recent advances in the analysis and design of algebraic flux correction (AFC)
schemes for hyperbolic problems. In contrast to most variational stabilization techniques, AFC approaches
modify the standard Galerkin discretization in a way which provably guarantees the validity of discrete
maximum principles for scalar conservation laws and invariant domain preservation for hyperbolic systems.
The corresponding inequality constraints are enforced by adding diffusive fluxes, and bound-preserving
antidiffusive corrections are performed to obtain nonlinear high-order approximations. After introducing the
AFC methodology and the underlying theoretical framework in the context of continuous piecewise-linear finite
element discretizations, we present some of the limiting techniques that we use in high-resolution AFC schemes.
As an alternative to flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithms which apply limited antidiffusive corrections
to bound-preserving low-order solutions, we propose a new limiting strategy based on representation of these
solutions as convex combinations of "bar states" satisfying physical and numerical admissibility conditions.
Each antidiffusive flux is limited so as to guarantee that the associated bar state remains in the convex
invariant set and preserves appropriate local bounds. There is no free parameter, and the nonlinear discrete
problem is well-defined even in the steady-state limit. In the case study for the Euler equations of gas
dynamics, we enforce local maximum principles for the density, velocity, and specific total energy in addition
to positivity preservation for the density and pressure. The results of numerical studies for standard test
problems illustrate the ability of the methods under investigation to resolve steep gradients without
generating spurious oscillations. In the last part of this talk, we discuss the design of AFC schemes for
high-order finite elements. The approaches to be explored are based on the use of Bernstein basis functions
and partitioned finite element spaces.
