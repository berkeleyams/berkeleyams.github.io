<h4 class="top">Estimating Initial Conditions for Approximate Models with Incomplete Data</h4>
<h5><b>Robert Miller, Oregon State University</b></h5>

<p>In the absence of comprehensive observations, initial conditions and forcing
fields for models of the ocean and atmosphere must be estimated. In the case of
numerical weather prediction, initial conditions for continuing forecasts are
estimated by combining current observations with results of previous forecasts.
This process of estimating the state of the system by combining model output
with observation is known as &#8220;data assimilation.&#8221;
</p><p>
Ocean models intended for coupling to atmospheric models for climate
prediction or coupling to chemical or biological models are typically coarsely
resolved due to limitations on computing resources, and are not able to
simulate observed phenomena faithfully. Major ocean features such as the Gulf
Stream are often systematically misrepresented in position and strength, so
attempts to assimilate observations of the Gulf Stream into coarsely resolved
models result in systematic errors, as the model adjusts to the new input by
internal model dynamics that have no counterparts in nature.
</p><p>
Variability in observed data due to physical phenomena that are not
adequately modeled is known as &#8220;representation error,&#8221; and cannot
be usefully assimilated. We propose a method for distinguishing observed
variability that can be modeled from that which cannot, and present preliminary
results to demonstrate its effectiveness.
