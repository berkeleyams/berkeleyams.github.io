<h5><b>Matthew J. Zahr, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</b></h5>

<p>Optimization problems governed by partial differential equations are
ubiquitous in modern science, engineering, and mathematics. They
play a central role in optimal design and control of multiphysics systems,
data assimilation, and inverse problems. However, as the complexity of
the underlying PDE increases, efficient and robust methods to accurately
compute the objective function and its gradient become paramount. To
this end, I will present a globally high-order discretization of PDEs and
their quantities of interest and the corresponding fully discrete adjoint method
for use in a gradient-based PDE-constrained optimization setting. The framework
is applied to solve a slew of optimization problems including the design of
energetically optimal flapping motions, the design of energy harvesting
mechanisms, and data assimilation to dramatically enhance the resolution of
magnetic resonance images. In addition, I will demonstrate that the role of
optimization in computational physics extends well beyond these traditional
design and control problems. I will introduce a new method for the discovery
and high-order accurate resolution of shock waves in compressible flows using
PDE-constrained optimization techniques. The key feature of this method is an
optimization formulation that aims to align discontinuous features of the
solution basis with the discontinuities in the solution. The method is
demonstrated on a number of one- and two-dimensional transonic and supersonic
flow problems. In all cases, the framework tracks the discontinuity closely
with curved mesh elements and provides accurate solutions on extremely coarse
meshes.
