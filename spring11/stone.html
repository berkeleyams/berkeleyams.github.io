<h4 class="top">Transport processes and multiphase flows: (I) Shear-induced diffusion and (II) Developments of biofilms during flow</h4>
<h5><b>Howard Stone, Princeton University</b></h5>
<h5>March 30th, 2011 at 4PM&ndash;5PM in 939 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>Many processes contain suspended objects, which may be rigid particles, drops
and bubbles, cells, etc. These objects can alter the flow since they can be
distributed nonuniformly. In this talk, I describe two problems of this type.
In the first example, we develop a microfluidic approach to study the
transverse &#8220;diffusion&#8221; processes that occur when colloidal particles are
sheared. We report the shear-induced diffusivity for nonspherical particles,
which we show varies linearly with the number density of particles. We then
apply this result to a theoretical calculation of the Taylor dispersion of
colloids. Second, we study the development of biofilms on surfaces and identify
conditions that lead to &#8220;bacterial streamers&#8221;. In particular, we report the
formation of these filamentous structures suspended in the middle plane of
curved microchannels under conditions of laminar flow. We use numerical
simulations and analytical solutions of the three-dimensional flow in curved
channels to highlight the presence of a secondary vortical motion in the
proximity of the corners, which suggests an underlying hydrodynamic mechanism
responsible for the formation of the streamers. Thus, we bring together
experiments, simulations, and models to rationalize the spatial and temporal
development of bacterial streamers.
