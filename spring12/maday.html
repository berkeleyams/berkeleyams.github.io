<p>The numerical computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a
self-adjoint operator on an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space is a
standard problem of numerical analysis and scientific computing, with a wide
range of applications in science and engineering. Such problems are
encountered in particular in mechanics (vibrations of elastic structures),
electromagnetism and acoustics (resonant modes of cavities), and quantum
mechanics (bound states of quantum systems).</p>

<p>Galerkin methods provide an efficient way to compute the discrete
eigenvalues of a bounded-from-below self-adjoint operator <i>A</i> lying below
the bottom of the essentialspectrum of <i>A</i>. On the other hand, Galerkin
methods may fail to approximate discrete eigenvalues located in spectral gaps,
that is between two points of the essentialspectrum of <i>A</i>. In some cases,
the Galerkin method cannot find some of the eigenvalues of <i>A</i> located in
spectral gaps (lack of approximation); in other cases, the limit set of the
spectrum of the Galerkin approximations of <i>A</i> contains points which do
not belong to the spectrum of <i>A</i> (spectral pollution). Such problems
arise in various applications, such as the numerical simulation of photonic
crystals, of doped semiconductors, or of heavy atoms with relativistic
models.</p>

<p>Another aspect of this problem is the large nonlinearity and the complexity
that arise in the models derived from the Schr&ouml;dinger model. The numerical
analysis of these nonlinear eigenvalue problems makes it possible to understand
the convergence behavior, when it works but also when and why the numerical
algorithm lacks optimality. From this analysis corrections can be proposed and
implemented.</p>

<p>We will present recent results on the numerical analysis of these problems,
obtained in collaboration with Rachida Chakir (University Paris 6) and Virginie
Ehrlacher (Ecole des Ponts and INRIA).</p>
