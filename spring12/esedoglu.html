<h4 class="top">Threshold dynamics for the mean curvature motion of networks with unequal surface tensions</h4>
<h5><b>Selim Esedoglu, University of Michigan</b></h5>
<h5>April 25th, 2012 at 4PM&ndash;5PM in 939 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>Threshold dynamics is an algorithm for moving an interface (<i>e.g.</i> a surface in
3D) by mean curvature motion. It was proposed by Merriman, Bence, and Osher in
1992, and also extended to networks of surfaces in the same paper. This dynamic
arises as gradient flow for the sum of the areas of the surfaces in the
network, and plays a prominent role in materials science applications where it
describes the motion of grain boundaries in polycrystals (such as most metals)
under heat treatment.
</p><p>
Further extension of the algorithm to gradient flow for a weighted energy where
the area of each surface in the network is weighted by possibly different
constants (called surface tensions) is of great interest for applications, but
has remained elusive. In fact, previous attempts at this turn out to be flawed,
mainly due to the difficulty of ensuring that certain natural angle conditions
are satisfied along triple curves (where three surfaces meet). We describe how
to extend threshold dynamics to this unequal surface tension setting. Joint
work with Felix Otto.
