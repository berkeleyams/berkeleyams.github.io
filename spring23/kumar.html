<h4 class="top">Application of branching flows to optimal scalar transport and a result concerning the nonuniqueness of trajectories</h4>
<h5><b>Anuj Kumar, UC Santa Cruz</b></h5>
<h5>1/25, 2023 at 4:10PM-5PM in 939 Evans (for in-person talks) and <a href="https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98667278310">https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98667278310</a></h5>
<p>We are interested in the design of forcing in the Navier&ndash;Stokes equation such that the resultant flow maximizes the transport of a passive temperature between two differentially heated walls for a given power supply budget. Previous work established that the transport cannot scale faster than 1/3-power of the power supply. Recently, Doering &amp; Tobasco (CPAM'19) constructed self-similar two-dimensional steady branching flows, saturating this upper bound up to a logarithmic correction to scaling. We present a construction of three-dimensional "branching pipe flows" that eliminates the possibility of this logarithmic correction and for which the corresponding passive scalar transport scales as a clean 1/3-power law in power supply. However, using an unsteady branching flow construction, it appears that the 1/3 scaling is also optimal in two dimensions. After carefully examining these designs, we extract the underlying physical mechanism that makes the branching flows "efficient," based on which we present a design of mechanical apparatus that, in principle, can achieve the best possible case scenario of heat transfer.
</p><p>
Finally, we present an application of branching flows to a study concerning the nonuniqueness of trajectories. After the theory of DiPerna&ndash;Lions'89, a question remained, whether there are continuous Sobolev vector fields such that the trajectories are not unique on a set of positive measures. Recently, an answer to this question was partially given, see, for example, Bru√®, Colombo and De Lellis'21 and Fefferman et al.'21. Borrowing a few ideas from our study on optimal scalar transport, we present an explicit construction of a vector field that fully resolves this question.
