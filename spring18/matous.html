<p>With concentrated efforts from the material science community to develop new multi- functional materials using unique processing conditions, the need for modeling tools that accurately describe the physical phenomena at each length scale has only further been emphasized. For example, additive manufacturing and shock synthesis lead to unique material morphologies that need to be understood for reliable engineering analysis and product safety assessments. Considering these material complexities, Direct Numerical Modeling (DNM) is accessible only for moderate system sizes. Thus, a multiscale strategy must recognize that just a relatively small part of the material will typically be instantaneously exposed to rapid material transformations. Macroscopic constitutive models obtained from homogenization, of the complex but slowly varying microstructure, may adequately describe the rest of the material. Nonlinear model reduction, pattern recognition and data-mining are a key to future on-the-fly modeling and rapid decision making.
</p><p>
To address these challenges, we present an image-based (data-driven) multiscale framework for modeling the chemo-thermo-mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials while capturing the large range of spatial and temporal scales. This integrated computational approach for predicting the behavior of complex heterogeneous systems combines macro- and micro- continuum representations with statistical techniques, nonlinear model reduction and high- performance computing. Our approach exploits the instantaneous localization knowledge to decide where more advanced computations are required. Simulations involving this wide range of scales, O(106) from nm to mm, and billions of computational cells are inherently expensive, requiring use of high-performance computing. Therefore, we have developed a hierarchically parallel high- performance computational framework that executes on hundreds of thousands of processing cores with exceptional scaling performance.
</p><p>
Any serious attempt to model a heterogeneous system must also include a strategy for constructing a complex computational domain. This work follows the concept of data-driven (image-based) modeling. We will delineate a procedure based on topology optimization and machine learning to construct a Representative Unit Cell (RUC) with the same statistics (n-point probability functions) to that of the original material. Our imaging sources come from micro- computed-tomography (micro-CT), focused ion beam (FIB) sectioning, and advanced photon source nano-tomography at the Argonne National Laboratory. We show that high-performance DNM of these statistically meaningful RUCs coupled on-the-fly to a macroscopic domain is possible. Therefore, well-resolved microstructure-statistics-property (MSP) relationships can be obtained.
</p><p>
Finally, the integrated V&amp;V/UQ program with co-designed simulations and experiments provides a platform for computational model verification, validation and propagation of uncertainties.
