<h4 class="top">A higher-accuracy discontinuous Galerkin method for variable-coefficient advection-diffusion problems</h4>
<h5><b>Raunak Borker, Stanford University</b></h5>

<p>A discontinuous Galerkin method with Lagrange multipliers (DGLM) with
higher-accuracy is presented for the solution of the steady
advection-diffusion equation with a variable advection field in the high
Peclet number regime. In this regime, the standard finite element method
(FEM) might produce non-physical oscillations in the solution at practical
mesh resolutions. Like a Discontinuous Enrichment Method (DEM) [1], the DGLM
method described in this presentation overcomes the issue of spurious
oscillations near boundary layers by attempting to resolve them using
appropriate shape functions. Specifically, these are chosen as polynomials
that are additively enriched with free-space solutions of the governing
differential equation. Also like a DEM, the DGLM method presented here in
enforces a weak continuity of the solution across inter-element boundaries
using Lagrange multipliers and is amenable to efficient numerical technique
of static condensation. DGLM is based on the primal hybrid-variational
formulation. Unlike a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods however, it operates
directly on the second-order form of the advection-diffusion equation and
does not require any stabilization.
</p><p>
Recently in [2], DGLM was developed for the constant coefficient
advection-diffusion problem. The present work focuses on the extensions of
this approach to the variable coefficient problem. The major challenge in
this extension is in deriving free-space solutions for the variable
advection-field case. This challenge is overcome by using asymptotic analysis
which provides enrichment functions for exponential and parabolic boundary
layers. The resulting DGLM method is theoretically proven to be well-posed.
</p><p>
This talk will introduce the DGLM framework, the enrichment functions for the
constant and variable coefficient cases, and discuss possible extensions to
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results for the
advection-diffusion equation demonstrating the benefits of the enrichment
functions in overcoming oscillations by reducing the error constant and hence
improving the accuracy will be presented.
