<h5><b>Wei Cai, Stanford University</b></h5>

<p>A major challenge in materials science is to understand and control the properties of materials based
on the microstructure evolution at the mesoscale. For a wide range of materials, the relevant
microstructures consist of a network of line objects. In this talk, I will use three examples to illustrate
how the study of geometric/topological features of line networks can help us understand the
microstructure-property relationship of materials.
The first example deals with dislocation line networks in crystals (such as metals) under plastic
deformation. Over the last two decades, much effort has been placed on the prediction of stress-strain
curve of single crystals through large-scale dislocation dynamics (DD) simulations. Our DD
simulations reveal that the dislocation line lengths follow an exponential distribution in a dislocation
microstructure of single crystal Cu under uniaxial loading along the [001] direction. A Boltzmann-type
theory developed to explain this exponential distribution also reveals the new insights on the origin of
strain hardening.
In the second example, we consider a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) model of an
elastomer in which the cross-link bonds can be broken. It is found that bond breaking caused by
uniaxial loading does not occur at random locations in the polymer chain network. Instead they occur
on shortest paths connecting far away beads (monomers). The evolution of the length distribution of
shortest paths is found to control the stress-strain response of the elastomer.
The third example is concerned with a planar network of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on an elastic
substrate, acting as a stretchable electrode. The electrical resistance of the CNT network is measured
during cyclic loading to progressively larger maximum strains. The hysteretic behavior of the
resistance R as a function of strain ε is explained through the evolution of a microstructural parameter,
β, the relative coverage of single tubes, with strain. Analytical expressions are obtained for the
relation between β and strain ε, and between β and electrical resistance R, which are consistent with
both coarse-grained molecular statics (CGMS) simulations and experiments.
