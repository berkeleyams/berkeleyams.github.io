<h4 class="top">High-Order Methods for Optimization and Control of Conservation Laws on Deforming Domains</h4>

<p>PDE-constrained optimization has become an essential tool in the
design of steady-state engineering systems, but is less commonly used
for unsteady problems due to the large cost associated with repeated
solving the underlying PDE.  However, there is a large-class of
problems that are inherently unsteady, such as flow past airfoils at a
high angle of attack, flow through wind farms, and flapping flight,
that would benefit from numerical optimization. In this work, a
globally high-order numerical scheme is developed for the
discretization of conservation laws on deforming domains, and the
corresponding fully-discrete adjoint method is derived.  The numerical
scheme is used to compute relevant output functionals of the
conservation law, and their gradients, for the use in gradient-based
nonlinear optimization.  An adaptive model reduction strategy is
developed for reducing the cost of the numerical solver by searching
for the solution in a small affine subspace, which is built on-the-fly
during the optimization procedure.  The proposed framework is
demonstrated on a selection of optimal control and shape optimization
problems, where the compressible Navier-Stokes equations are taken as
the constraining PDE.
