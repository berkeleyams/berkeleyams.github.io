Quantum signal processing (QSP) studies quantum circuits interleaving known unitaries (the phases) and unknown unitary oracles encoding a hidden scalar (the signal). For a wide class of functions one can quickly compute the phases for a QSP protocol with a matrix element approximately equal to the application of this function to the signal; surprisingly, this simple ability unifies the presentation and analysis of most quantum algorithms. A separate, basic problem in quantum computing is gate approximation: realistic devices support only a subset of possible gates, and extensive results establish methods to (approximately) compile one's available gates to a desired one. Among these results, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem (SKT) establishes an equivalence between the universality of a gate set (its density in a compact Lie group) and the existence of short approximating sequences. QSP, alternatively, considers a single program (the phases) such that for all among a continuum of possible input signals a desired output unitary is achieved, and so resembles a `lifted' variant of gate approximation.
    We make this notion of lifting formal, constructing an `SKT for QSP,' establishing an equivalence between the density of a circuit ansatz in a specific functional class and the existence of short protocols. These methods provide alternative proofs for basic results in QSP, and establish an intersection between QSP and the theory of gate-approximation. Unlike prior work, our proofs are not required to be constructive and are surprisingly insensitive to the chosen ansatz&mdash;they comprise loosely coupled, swappable components amenable to ansatz extensions for which standard QSP proof methods fail completely. These strengths align with an insight of the standard Solovay-Kitaev theorem: that it is often easier to work with Lie algebras than Lie groups. By carefully linearizing certain aspects of QSP, we intermesh algebraic-geometric techniques from gate approximation with well-understood functional-analytic properties of QSP, bootstrapping tools strong enough to analyze diverse unitary ans√§tze.
