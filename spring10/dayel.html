<h4 class="top">A Model for Actin-Based Symmetry Breaking and Motility</h4>
<h5><b>Mark Dayel, UC Berkeley</b></h5>

<p>Eukaryotic cells assemble viscoelastic networks of crosslinked actin
filaments to control their shape, mechanical properties, and motility. One
important class of actin network is nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex and drives
both membrane protrusion at the leading edge of motile cells and intracellular
motility of pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. These networks can be
reconstituted in vitro from purified components to drive the motility of
spherical micron-sized beads. An Elastic Gel model has been successful in
explaining how these networks break symmetry, but how they produce directed
motile force has been less clear. We have combined numerical simulations with
in vitro experiments to reconstitute the behavior of these motile actin
networks in silico using an Accumulative Particle-Spring (APS) model that
builds on the Elastic Gel model, and demonstrates simple intuitive mechanisms
for both symmetry breaking and sustained motility. The APS model explains
observed transitions between smooth and pulsatile motion as well as subtle
variations in network architecture caused by differences in geometry and
conditions. Our findings also explain sideways symmetry breaking and motility
of elongated beads, and show that elastic recoil, though important for symmetry
breaking and pulsatile motion, is not necessary for smooth directional
motility. The APS model demonstrates how a small number of viscoelastic network
parameters and construction rules suffice to recapture the complex behavior of
motile actin networks. The fact that the model not only mirrors our in vitro
observations, but also makes novel predictions that we confirm by experiment,
suggests that the model captures much of the essence of actin-based motility in
this system.
