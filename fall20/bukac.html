<p>Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems arise in many applications, such as aerodynamics, geomechanics and hemodynamics. They are moving domain, multiphysics problems characterized by nonlinear coupling between a fluid and structure. As a result, FSI problems are challenging to numerically solve and analyze. A popular approach is to solve the fluid and structure sub-problems in a partitioned manner, allowing the use of solvers specifically designed for the physics of each subproblem. However, stability issues often arise as a result of FSI coupling unless the design and implementation of a partitioned scheme is carefully developed. We will present a family of partitioned numerical schemes for the interaction between an incompressible, viscous fluid and an elastic structure.  We will consider cases where the structure is thick, <i>i.e.</i>, described using the same number of spatial dimensions as the fluid, and when the structure is thin, i.e., described using a lower-dimensional model. We will present stability and convergence results, as well as numerical examples where the presented methods are compared to other methods in the literature.
