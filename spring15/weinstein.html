<h4 class="top">Topologically protected edge states in continuous two-dimensional honeycomb structures</h4>
<h5><b>Michael Weinstein, Columbia University (note special date and time)</b></h5>
<h5>February 19th, 2015 at 4:10PM&ndash;5PM in 60 Evans Hall <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html">[Map]</a></h5>
<p>An edge state is a time-harmonic mode of a conservative wave system, 
<i>e.g.</i> Schroedinger, Maxwell, which is propagating (plane-wave-like) parallel to and localized, 
transverse to a line-defect or &#8220;edge‚Äù.  
Topologically protected edge states are edge states which are immune to local scattering impurities.
</p><p>
First studied in the context of the quantum Hall effect, protected edge states 
have attracted great interest recently due to their role in the field of topological insulators.
Such states are potential vehicles for robust energy-transfer
in the presence of strong localized defects and random imperfections.
They are therefore considered ideal for use in nano-scale devices.
</p><p>
The theoretical understanding of topological protection
has mainly come from discrete (tight-binding) models and direct numerical simulation. 
 
After an introduction to the spectral properties of continuous honeycomb structures 
and their novel properties such as Dirac points, we introduce a rich family of continuum
PDE models and discuss regimes  (&#8220;phases") where topologically protected edge states exist 
along a &#8220;zig-zag edge", and regimes where edge states may exist but are not protected.
 
These results follow from a general theorem on the bifurcation of edge states from Dirac points 
of the background honeycomb structure. This bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of an effective Dirac equation.
The key to applying the general theorem is the verification of a spectral no-fold condition along the zig-zag edge.

This is joint work with C.L. Fefferman and J.P. Lee-Thorp.
