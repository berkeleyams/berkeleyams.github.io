<h5><b>Yousef Saad, University of Minnesota</b></h5>

<p>Algorithms based on Divide and  conquer paradigms can lead to complex,
but  efficient and  flexible  algorithms for  solving large  Hermitian
eigenvalue  problems.   This  talk   will  discuss  how  various  such
strategies can  be combined to exploit both  `spectrum slicing', <i>i.e.</i>,
computing   slices   of  the   spectrum   independently,  and   domain
decomposition.   These strategies  are independent  of each  other but
both  are essential  if one  has to  compute very  large parts  of the
spectrum, as is  the case in approaches that  deal with excited states
in solid state physics.  The  presentation will begin with an overview
of  polynomial filtering  techniques.   This general  approach can  be
quite  efficient  in the  situation  where  the matrix-vector  product
operation is  inexpensive and  when a large  number of  eigenvalues is
sought.  We  present an  algorithm  (and  package)  that combines  the
Lanczos  algorithm  with  partial reorthogonalization  and  polynomial
filtering.  An alternative to  polynomial filtering that is generating
a growing  interest is  a class of  methods that exploit  filtering by
rational functions. Good representatives  of this general approach are
the FEAST eigensolver and the Sakurai-Sugiura algorithm.  Here we will
argue that the standard way of selecting these rational filters, which
is based on  using the Cauchy integral, can  be substantially improved
&ndash; especially when iterative solvers  are involved.  Finally, the talk
will  discuss  our  ongoing  work on  Domain-Decomposition  (DD)  type
methods that rely on spectral Schur complements combined with Newton's
iteration.
